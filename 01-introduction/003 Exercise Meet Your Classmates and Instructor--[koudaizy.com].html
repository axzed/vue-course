<h4><strong>1. Before we get started, let's do a quick exercise that will take less than 3 minutes:</strong></h4><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Click on this link to join our Private Online Classroom: <a href="https://discord.gg/Dy3SBaVmdq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>CLICK HERE TO JOIN NOW</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p><p><br><strong>Step 2 -&nbsp; </strong>Once inside, go to <strong>#introductions </strong>channel and share who you are, where you are from, and why you chose to do this course. <br><br><strong>Step 3 - &nbsp;</strong>Go to the <strong>#accountability-buddies </strong>and find a buddy who is starting a ZTM course today just like you <em>(doesn't have to be the same course)</em>!&nbsp;You will be keeping each other accountable throughout the course and motivating each other to finish. Who knows, maybe you will find life long friends/coworkers this way.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Step 4 - </strong>check out <strong>#general</strong> or your course specific channel to meet others in your class. We will be announcing class hangouts and instructor meetups/livestreams in there. Some of the channels available for you to join are:</p><p><br><strong><em>#vue -&nbsp;</em></strong><em>For all questions/topics around&nbsp;Vue.js<br></em><strong><em>#alumni -&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Ask graduates of this course questions<br></em><strong><em>#womenintech - </em></strong><em>For the female coders out there<br></em><strong><em>#job-hunting - </em></strong><em>Anything related to finding a job as a developer<br></em></p><p><em>....and many many more!!</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>OPTIONAL Step - </strong>A fellow ZTM&nbsp;student, Matt, has made a video walkthrough for you of the community <a href="https://youtu.be/TVI_MBoCOak" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> </strong>if you want to watch and take a deep dive as to all the things that happen in the community every month. <br></p><p><br></p><h4><strong>2. Course updates and cheatsheets?<br></strong></h4><p>We are constantly adding new videos and updating this course, announcing new community events, and creating course cheatsheets/resources. To stay up to date with all the latest changes to the course and new videos, keep an eye out on the <strong>#announcements</strong> channel in our Discord community. Anything important will be announced in there <em>(you can scroll to see past announcements)</em>. </p><p><strong><br>You can also follow me on twitter where I keep you updated about industry news, upcoming courses, and random thoughts on life: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/AndreiNeagoie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>@andreineagoie</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/zerotomasteryio" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>@zerotomasteryio</strong></a><br></p><h4><br><br><strong>3. One more thing...</strong></h4><p><br></p><p>As you start the course, Udemy will have a popup that&nbsp; will ask you to leave a review  of the course. Yes, it can get a little annoying <em>(it's a Udemy system and not something we have control over)</em> but please leave an honest review <em>(even if you just started the course)</em> as it really helps us out and allows more people to discover this course in this massively competitive marketplace. It would truly mean a lot .<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br><br><br></strong>Thank you and welcome to ZTM!<br><br>- Andrei</p><p><br></p><p><img height="215" src="https://img-b.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2021-03-09_13-54-24-8b2ccf9752b026233a7ebd195d792254.png" width="213"></p><p><br></p>
